  <h2>About the Campaign</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Danychawraba1 was created to respond to one of Lebanon’s most urgent environmental crises: water pollution. Rivers that once supported agriculture, wildlife, and local communities are now under constant threat from industrial waste, sewage discharge, plastic pollution, and unregulated construction.</p>
    <p>Our mission is simple but powerful: protect, restore, and respect Lebanon’s water. We work to raise awareness, educate communities, and support real action on the ground. Clean water is not a luxury. It is a basic human right and a shared responsibility.</p>
    <p>Through research, field activities, and public engagement, we aim to reconnect people with their rivers and beaches. When people understand the value of water, they become its strongest defenders.</p>

  <h2>Rivers of Lebanon</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Litani River</h3>
    <p>The Litani is Lebanon’s longest river and a critical source of water for agriculture, electricity, and daily life. It runs through the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon.</p>
    <p>Industrial discharge, sewage, and agricultural chemicals have severely polluted the river, making restoration a national priority.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Abu Ali River</h3>
    <p>Flowing through Tripoli, the Abu Ali River has historical importance but suffers from heavy pollution caused by untreated wastewater and solid waste dumping.</p>
    <p>Flooding during winter increases health risks for nearby communities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Nahr El Kalb</h3>
    <p>Nahr El Kalb is famous for its ancient inscriptions and cultural value. Urban expansion and waste dumping have degraded its water quality.</p>
    <p>Protecting this river preserves both history and nature.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Hasbani River</h3>
    <p>The Hasbani River originates in southern Lebanon and contributes to regional water systems. It supports agriculture and rural communities.</p>
    <p>Pollution and water overuse threaten its long-term sustainability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Orontes (Assi) River</h3>
    <p>The Orontes River flows in northern Lebanon before continuing into neighboring countries. It plays an important role in irrigation.</p>
    <p>Industrial waste and reduced water flow impact its ecological balance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Awali River</h3>
    <p>The Awali River flows from the Chouf Mountains toward the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important freshwater source.</p>
    <p>Urban development and waste dumping threaten its cleanliness.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Ibrahim River</h3>
    <p>The Ibrahim River is one of Lebanon’s most scenic rivers, flowing through valleys and forests.</p>
    <p>Despite its beauty, pollution and unregulated development put pressure on the ecosystem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Damour River</h3>
    <p>The Damour River flows near residential areas and agricultural land.</p>
    <p>Sewage discharge and waste dumping are major threats to water quality.</p>
  </div>

<section id="beaches">
  <h2>Lebanon’s Beaches</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Beirut Coast</h3>
    <p>Beirut’s coastline stretches along the heart of the capital and reflects both the beauty and the challenges of urban life by the sea. The coast is used daily by residents for walking, fishing, swimming, and relaxation.</p>
    <p>Pollution from sewage outlets, plastic waste, and port activity affects water quality and marine life. Protecting Beirut’s coast is essential for public health and the city’s identity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Ramlat El Bayda Beach</h3>
    <p>Ramlat El Bayda is Beirut’s last free public sandy beach and a symbol of equal access to the sea. It is a vital space for families, athletes, and young people.</p>
    <p>Sewage pollution, uncontrolled construction, and waste threaten this beach. Preserving Ramlat El Bayda means protecting public space and marine ecosystems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Byblos (Jbeil) Beach</h3>
    <p>Jbeil, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, has a coastline rich in history and tourism. Its beaches attract visitors from across Lebanon and abroad.</p>
    <p>Pollution from boats, wastewater, and urban runoff threatens the clarity of the water and archaeological heritage. Sustainable tourism is key to protecting Jbeil’s coast.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Batroun Coast</h3>
    <p>Batroun is famous for its clear waters, rocky beaches, and strong connection between the town and the sea. It is a major destination for swimming and water sports.</p>
    <p>Despite its beauty, Batroun faces challenges from plastic waste and seasonal overcrowding. Responsible tourism and waste management are essential to preserve this coastline.</p>

  <h2>Why Water Protection Matters</h2>
  <div class="two-cols">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>Polluted water spreads disease and increases medical costs. Clean rivers and beaches protect families, especially children and the elderly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>Healthy water ecosystems support fish, birds, and plant life. Pollution destroys biodiversity and weakens nature’s ability to recover.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Economy</h3>
      <p>Tourism, agriculture, and fisheries all depend on clean water. Protecting water resources supports jobs and local communities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Future Generations</h3>
      <p>Every action taken today shapes the world tomorrow. Clean water ensures dignity and opportunity for the next generation.</p>
